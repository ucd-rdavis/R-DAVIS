<h3>Course Description</h3>
<p>Computer literacy is now essential in all aspects of science. Data
management skills are needed for entering data without errors, storing
it in a usable way, and extracting key aspects of the data for analysis.
Basic programming is required for everything from accessing and managing
data, data visualization, to statistical analysis, and modeling. This
course will provide an introduction to data/project management,
manipulation, visualization and analysis, across a broad set of
ecological data (spatial, genomic, field, etc). Class will typically
consist of short introductions or question &amp; answer sessions,
followed by hands on computing exercises. The course will be taught
using git/Github, R/RStudio, and RMarkdown, but the concepts learned
will easily apply to all programming languages and database management
systems. <strong>No background in databases or R/computational
experience is required.</strong></p>
</div>
<div id="prerequisite-knowledge-and-skills" class="section level3">
<h3>Prerequisite Knowledge and Skills</h3>
<ul>
<li>Willingness to practice coding</li>
<li>Willingness to try things</li>
<li>Willingness to fail</li>
<li>Willingness to put in the time</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="purpose-of-course" class="section level3">
<h3>Purpose of Course</h3>
<p>In this course you will learn fundamental aspects of computer
programming that are necessary for conducting ecological research. By
the end of the course you will be able to use these tools to import data
into R, wrangle various types of data, summarize and analyze data,
create visualizations, write reports/manuscripts/CV’s in RMarkdown, save
and export data/figures, as well as collaborate on Github with
version-controlled projects.</p>
<p>The focus of this course is to provide graduate students with
training that develops and teaches the tools applicable to the entire
process of <strong>reproducible data-driven research</strong> and
encourage the use of open-source tools. By learning how to get the
computer to do your work for you, you will be able to do more science
faster, and your future-self will thank you.</p>
</div>
<div id="course-objectives" class="section level3">
<h3>Course Objectives</h3>
<p>Students completing this course should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Organize R projects in GitHub</li>
<li>Read, import/export data</li>
<li>Tidy/summarize and analyze data</li>
<li>Create publication-quality graphs and figures</li>
<li>Write simple functions/programs in R</li>
<li>Search for and access new learning materials to further develop
their computational skills</li>
<li>Apply these tools to address scientific research questions</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="course-format" class="section level3">
<h3>Course Format</h3>
<p>To get the most out of in-class time together, R-DAVIS will combine
video material that you watch outside of class with in-person discussion
and hands-on activities that we do together in class. Unless unforeseen
circumstances arise, videos will be posted by Monday to the relevant
week on the Lectures page. Please come to class having watched the
material relevant to that week’s lesson, completed the video quiz, and
perhaps having taken a cursory attempt at trying out what is covered in
the videos. We are organizing the course this way so as to spend less of
our time together lecturing, and more time working and learning
together.</p>
</div>
<div id="grading-and-class-expectations" class="section level3">
<h3>Grading and Class Expectations</h3>
<p>R-DAVIS is a graded, 3-unit course. The <a
href="https://registrar.ucdavis.edu/faculty-staff/faculty/courses#:~:text=Academic%20Credit%2C%20Units%2C%20&amp;%20Workload,Committee%20on%20Courses%20of%20Instruction.&amp;text=The%20value%20of%20a%20course,a%20student%2C%20or%20the%20equivalent">university’s
formula</a> for a 3-unit course is that you should expect to spend ~9
hours a week in total on the course. You might spend less time then
that, or some weeks you might spend more. Regardless, if you only put in
work during the scheduled class time, you are unlikely to meet learning
goals for the course.</p>
<p>R-DAVIS grades are based on a combination of several tasks and
deliverables. The total number of possible points earned is 250 points.
Grades are calculated at points_earned/270</p>
<ul>
<li>A = 93-100% | A- = 90-92%</li>
<li>B+ = 87-89 | B = 83-86 | B- = 80-82%</li>
<li>C+ = 77-79 | C = 73-76 | C- = 70-72%</li>
<li>D = 60-69%</li>
<li>F = &lt; 60%</li>
</ul>
<p>Points are earned as follows: - Submitting weekly in-class scratch
work. These submissions are credit/no-credit (but we will pay attention
to good faith effort) NOTE: WEEKLY IN-CLASS SCRATCH WORK FUNCTIONS AS
ATTENDANCE. R-DAVIS only has 10 class sessions (and 10 labs), so missing
class means that you are missing a sizable chunk of the course. 10
weeks, 10 points each, out of 90 (i.e., we will drop one (1) absence).
The absence can be for any reasons, we do not have “excused” and
“unexcused” absences in this course. - Submitting take-home labs. These
submissions are credit/no-credit, but again will be reviewed for
good-faith effort (primarily, evidence of working and learning). 9
take-home labs, 10 points each, 90 points total. - Midterm Exam:
In-class exam, 45 points - Final Exam: In-class (during
university-designated examp period), 45 points</p>
<p>We will not take attendance for Tuesday afternoon discussion
sections, since not all students are typically there at the same time.
But we strongly encourage you to attend. Our experience is that students
who engage with R more times during the week have much better learning
outcomes.</p>
</div>
<div id="pedagogy" class="section level3">
<h3>Pedagogy</h3>
<p>We believe that instructors have a duty to examine their pedagogy–and
students have a right to know the pedagogical assumptions that shape our
course. This section describes the five key principles that motivate our
course. It is also an invitation to dialogue on how these can be
improved.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<div id="equity-is-a-vital-social-project" class="section level4">
<h4>Equity is a vital social project</h4>
<p>Many educational institutions and practices perpetuate the
discrimination of our wider society, further marginalizing Black, Brown,
and Indigenous people, people of differing abilities, and people of
genders or gender identities other than those reflecting “conventional”
notions of male masculinity. In perhaps no field of academia is this
reality more apparent than in Science, Technology, Engineering, and
Mathematics (STEM) fields. We are committed to diversity
(social/demographic differences such as race, ethnicity, gender, sex,
sexual orientation, ability, and language) and the pursuit of equity
(the fair distribution of resources and opportunities, accounting for
past and present events, conditions, and contexts) as a vital project in
and outside of the classroom. We are also acutely aware that we will
fall short of these ideals — as will our teaching. We invite you to hold
us and this course to them, and to help us learn.</p>
</div>
<div id="inaccessibility-is-a-choice" class="section level4">
<h4>Inaccessibility is a choice</h4>
<p>Inaccessibility is a choice (and choosing accessibility benefits
all). Accessibility is both more necessary and easier than acknowledged.
As the case of <a
href="https://uxdesign.cc/the-curb-cut-effect-universal-design-b4e3d7da73f5">curb
cuts</a> famously demonstrates, anything that delivers greater
accessibility tends to benefit everyone. While digital tools and
contexts offer the promise of flexible inclusion in the form of
customizable, one-size-fits-one experience, we realize, that many of the
tools and practices we use in data science and statistical programming
fall short of even modest accessibility goals. With apologies for the
extra time and energy it demands, we ask you to let us know as soon as
you encounter any part of this course that impedes your participation,
so that we can prioritize its immediate correction.</p>
</div>
<div id="people-come-first" class="section level4">
<h4>People come first</h4>
<p>Physical, emotional, psychological, and spiritual trauma are real and
have real impacts on one’s ability to engage in learning. Courses that
ignore the inevitable conditions of life undermine learning. Our
commitment to your academic journey means that your wellbeing comes
first. Whatever difficulties you encounter–jobs, illness, family, the
world simply falling apart around us–know that we implicitly trust you
to be where you need to be, and do what you need to be doing, for
yourself and others.</p>
</div>
<div id="failure-is-productive" class="section level4">
<h4>Failure is productive</h4>
<p>Data science and programming are all about learning from
failure–stuff like fixing bugs, troubleshooting messy data, and figuring
out why your model blew up. You will learn the most by trying something,
having it break, trying to decipher the error message, and iterating
until you get it to work. We want to encourage you to take risks, fail
repeatedly, and learn volumes in the process. In practice, this means
that we would <em>much</em> rather have you only get half of a lab done,
but really understand that half, instead of borrowing your friends’ code
that you don’t really understand and completing the lab. To put our
money where our mouth is: <em>in-class work and labs is credit/no-credit
and NOT graded based on completion</em>. We <em>will</em> pay attention
to effort and evidence of learning. That means that w want to see your
work and your scratch code and how you got where you got <em>MUCH</em>
more than we want to see a perfectly rendered AI code block that you
made when you couldn’t figure it all out and panicked about wanting a
completed assignment.</p>
</div>
<div id="busywork-is-bad" class="section level4">
<h4>Busywork is bad</h4>
<p>We want this course to be a “no busy work” space. On a micro-level,
if you find an assignment unproductive, feel free to propose an
alternate activity that achieves the same/similar aims. On a
macro-level, if you find this training unproductive, feel free to
propose an alternative curriculum that achieves the same/similar aims
(e.g., doing labs in the Python programming language instead of R and
duplicating the workflow and version control elements of the course).
During the first week of the quarter, you will have an opportunity to
develop a customize plan for the quarter (this can just be following the
primary course plan, but it doesn’t have to be).</p>

<div id="territory-acknowledgement" class="section level3">
<h3>Territory Acknowledgement</h3>
<p>Acknowledging territory shows recognition of and respect for Native
Americans. It is recognition of their presence both in the past and the
present. Recognition and respect are essential elements of establishing
healthy, reciprocal relations. These relationships are key to
reconciliation, a process to which we are committed.</p>
<p>We would like to respectfully acknowledge that the land on which we

<h3>Academic Integrity</h3>
<p>As a University of California, Davis student, you have agreed to
abide by the University’s Code of Academic Conduct (<a
href="http://sja.ucdavis.edu/files/cac.pdfLinks"
class="uri">http://sja.ucdavis.edu/files/cac.pdfLinks</a> to an external
site.). All academic work must meet these standards. Lack of knowledge
of the academic honesty policy is not a reasonable explanation for a
violation. Questions related to course assignments and the academic
honesty policy should be directed to the instructor.</p>

<h3>Special Accommodations</h3>
<p>If you have a learning disability, sensory or physical disability or
if English is not your first language and you need special assistance in
lecture, reading assignments, or written assignments, please contact the
instructor at the beginning of the quarter. While students are welcome
to work with us on accommodations without involving UCD’s Student
Disability Center (SDC), we also recommend that you contact the SDC for
additional resources and support. The SDC office at the University of
California, Davis is located at 54 Cowell Building, or the SDC can be
reached by phone at (530) 752-3184. For more information, please see: <a

<h3>Course Support</h3>
<p>This course content integrates and builds on Data Carpentry Ecology
lessons. Course support is proviced by the UCD College of Agricultural
and Environmental Sciences. Advice from Ethan White (University of
Florida), Jenny Bryan (University of British Columbia), and Tracy Teal
(The Carpentries) was also helpful in guiding the course implementation.
The original version of this course at UCD was led by Liza Wood,
Christian John, and Tara Pozzi (among others).</p>

<p>Data Carpentry develops and teaches workshops on the fundamental data
skills needed to conduct research. Our mission is to provide researchers
high-quality, domain-specific training covering the full lifecycle of
data-driven research. Data Carpentry is now a lesson program within The
Carpentries, having merged with Software Carpentry in January, 2018.
Data Carpentry’s focus is on the introductory computational skills
needed for data management and analysis in all domains of research. Our
lessons are domain-specific, and build on the existing knowledge of
learners to enable them to quickly apply skills learned to their own
research. Our initial target audience is learners who have little to no
prior computational experience. We create a friendly environment for
learning to empower researchers and enable data driven discovery.</p>
